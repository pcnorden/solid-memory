This is a side project that I'm making for work where I need to calibrate a lot of dial indicators, which would require a lot of image processing since the dial indicators are the cheap kind that doesn't use any sort of electronics to measure distance.

This is very much a side project that will be worked on-and-off through my spare time and have no clear direction, but hopefully once more features are added, this readme will include more information.
